# 💥 C++ Data Structures Implementation

## 📖 Overview

**C++ Data Structures Implementation** is a collection of core data structures implemented in **C++** from scratch, without using STL containers.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how **complex systems** are built by combining **simple, reusable data structures**, just like real-world software systems.

This repository is designed as a solid foundation that can be extended into more advanced systems in the future.

It applies every Data Structures projects learned throughout the course **_“Course 13 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 5”_** with **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**

## 🎯 Learning Purpose

This repository focuses on learning and practicing:

- **Data Structures implementation**
- **Manual memory management**
- **Algorithmic thinking**
- **Code reusability**
- **Big O analysis**

---

## 🧩 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Doubly Linked List

**Doubly Linked List** implementation where each node contains pointers to both previous and next nodes.

- Insert
- Delete
- Search
- Reverse
- Update Item
- Clear

---

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Array

**Dynamic Array** simulates the behavior of `std::vector`.

- Automatic resizing
- Index-based access
- Insert
- Delete
- Search
- Reverse
- Update Item
- Clear

---

### 3️⃣ My Stack

**Stack (LIFO)** implementation.

- Push
- Pop
- Size
- IsEmpty
- top
- bottom
- Reverse
- Clear
---

### 4️⃣ My Queue

**Queue (FIFO)** implementation.

- Push
- Pop
- Size
- IsEmpty
- front
- back
- Reverse
- Clear

---

### 5️⃣ Undo – Redo System

**Undo / Redo system** built using stack-based logic to manage state history.

---

### 6️⃣ Queue Line

**Queue Line system** built using queue-based logic to manage ticket queue in real life.

---

## 🔗 Architecture Insight

**Complex data structures are built from simpler ones.**

Stack, Queue, and Undo–Redo reuse **Doubly Linked List** and/or **Dynamic Array**.

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **C++**
- **Object-Oriented Design**
- **Manual Memory Management**
- **Console-Based Applications**

---

## 💬 Final Thought

**Strong software systems are built on top of well-designed data structures.**
